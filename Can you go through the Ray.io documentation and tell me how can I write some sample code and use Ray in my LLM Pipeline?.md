## Answer
To write sample code and effectively use Ray in a Large Language Model (LLM) pipeline, you can follow these steps derived from the Ray documentation:

- **Set Up Ray Environment**:
  - First, ensure you have Ray installed in your Python environment. This can typically be done using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install ray
    ```

- **Integrate Ray with LLMs**:
  - Ray simplifies the process of deploying LLMs. You can leverage Ray Serve, which is designed for managing and scaling model serving. For example:
    ```python
    import ray
    from ray import serve

    ray.init()
    serve.start()

    @serve.deployment
    class MyLLMModel:
        def __init__(self):
            self.model = ... # Load your LLM model here

        def __call__(self, request):
            input_data = request["input"]
            return self.model.generate(input_data)  # Adjust according to your model's API

    MyLLMModel.deploy()
    ```

- **Handling Requests**:
  - Once your LLM model is deployed, you can interact with it via HTTP requests. Ray Serve provides a simple API to handle these requests efficiently.

- **Scaling**:
  - To handle larger workloads or multiple requests simultaneously, you can scale your model by deploying multiple replicas. For instance:
    ```python
    MyLLMModel.deploy(num_replicas=3)
    ```

- **Batch Processing**:
  - For efficiency, especially with large language models, consider implementing batch processing of inputs. This can help reduce the latency and improve throughput.

- **Using Ray for Data Processing**:
  - Incorporate Ray for preprocessing your input data before feeding it to the LLM. Rayâ€™s data processing libraries allow you to handle tasks like partitioning and transforming datasets efficiently. You can utilize methods like `.map()` and `.filter()` to process data in parallel [3](https://discuss.ray.io/t/using-ray-for-data-processing/8794).

- **Complete Example**:
  Here is a simplified code outline to encompass the steps above:
  ```python
  import ray
  from ray import serve

  ray.init()
  serve.start()

  @serve.deployment
  class LLMDeployment:
      def __init__(self):
          self.model = ... # Load your LLM here

      def __call__(self, input_data):
          return self.model.generate(input_data)

  LLMDeployment.deploy(num_replicas=3)

  # Data processing example
  data = [...]  # Your input data
  processed_data = ray.get([LLMDeployment.route.remote(d) for d in data])
  ```

This framework establishes a basic structure for using Ray in your LLM pipeline, allowing for efficient serving and scaling as needed.
